                        THE YALE SCHOOL OF ART IS A GRADUATE SCHOOL THAT CONFERS MASTER OF FINE ARTS DEGREES IN GRAPHIC

                <P>
                    Artists and designers of unusual promise and strong motivation are provided an educational context
                    in
                    which they can explore the potential of their own talents in the midst of an intense critical
                    dialogue.
                    This dialogue is generated by their peers, by distinguished visitors, and by a faculty comprised of
                    professional artists of acknowledged accomplishment.

                    activity. Supporting this enterprise are the experience, knowledge, and skills gained from rigorous,
                    structured courses such as drawing, filmmaking, the relativity of color, and the rich academic
                    offerings
                    found throughout Yale. Each student is routinely exposed to many aesthetic positions through
                    encounters
                    with faculty members and visitors. The School is devoted not only to the refinement of visual
                    skills,
                    but also to the cultivation of the mind. Students must bring creative force and imagination to their
                    own
                    development, for these qualities cannot be taught—they can only be stimulated and appreciated.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The graduate student’s primary educational experience at Yale is centered on the student’s own
                    studio
                    The School of Art offers an undergraduate art major for students in Yale College (see the bulletin
                    Yale
                    College Programs of Study). In addition, the School’s courses are open to students in the Graduate
                    School of Arts and Sciences and other professional schools of the University, and School of Art
                    students
                    may enroll in elective courses in the Graduate School and other professional schools as well as in
                    the
                    College with permission.

                <h4><strong>MASTER OF FINE ARTS DEGREE (MFAS)</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    The degree of Master of Fine Arts is the only degree offered by the School of Art. It is conferred
                    by
                    the
                    University upon recommendation of the faculty after successful completion of all course work in
                    residence and after a thesis presentation that has been approved by the faculty. It implies
                    distinctive
                    achievement on the part of students in studies in the professional area of their choice and
                    demonstrated
                    capacity for independent work. The minimum residence requirement is two years. All candidates’ work
                    is
                    reviewed by faculty at the end of each term. If the work is not considered satisfactory, the student
                    may
                    not be invited back to complete the program (see section on Review and Awards under Academic
                    Regulations
                    in the chapter General Information). All degree candidates are expected to be present at the
                    Commencement exercises in May unless excused by the dean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Course work for the Master of Fine Arts degree carries a minimum of sixty credits. The disposition
                    of
                    these credits varies according to the area of study and is agreed upon at the time of registration
                    between the student and the student’s faculty adviser.

                <h4><strong>PUBLIC LECTURES AND EXHIBITION</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    Each department has its own visitors program in which professionals from outside the School are
                    invited to lecture to students or take part in critiques.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The School also facilitates a public all-school lecture program, in which ideas of general and
                    cross-disciplinary importance are explored by visiting artists and members of the faculty in events
                    typically hosted in the evening that are free and open to the public.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The School of Art’s galleries in Green Hall and EIK at 32 Edgewood Avenue provide a year-round forum
                    for the exhibition of work by students, faculty, and special guests in the four graduate departments
                    of the School and the undergraduate program. Green Gallery is open to the public when exhibitions
                    are scheduled, but open hours vary by semester. EIK is open during limited hours for specific
                    exhibitions and events. Please refer to the Gallery & Publications page for more information.
